Overview

The NLP Interchange Format (NIF) is an RDF/OWL-based format that aims to achieve interoperability
between Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools, language resources and annotations. NIF consists of
specifications, ontologies and software. These documents describe the upcoming *NIF 2.1* release,
currently under revision by the broader community.

Although the road to complete interoperability is still long, NIF is already successful in providing
best practices and a solid foundation for the most frequent use cases. This foundation is created
by:

* Reusing existing standards such as RDF, OWL 2, the PROV Ontology and LAF (ISO 24612)
* Utilisation of NIF identifiers in the Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) Version 2.0
* Royality-free publishing of all parts of NIF under an open license.

NIF comprises a set of RDF vocabularies and ontologies, which have stable identifiers, persistent hosting, an open license and a community approved meaning.

NIF is driven by its open and weclome-to-join community project NLP2RDF, consisting of a mailing list, a GitHub Project and a blog web site.
